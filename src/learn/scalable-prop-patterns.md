title: Scalable Prop Patterns
workshop: true
---

## About

In almost every codebase, there is always that one component. You know the one that I am talking about. That one component where:

- It is difficult to understand how it works
- It is painful to make any changes to it
- People would rather create a new component instead of modifying the existing one
- The same developer keeps getting assigned to work on it because they are the only one who understand it

One of the common causes for this is the misuse of props. While props are one of the first techniques Vue.js developers learn, it is surprisingly complex because the technical debts do not show up until it is seemingly "too late" or "too difficult" to refactor and change. And before you know it, what was once a simple component becomes the component that no one wants to maintain.

In this workshop, you will be guided through fundamental prop techniques, best practices and patterns for creating scalable Vue.js components.

<h2 class="section-title">What You Will Learn</h2>

After taking this workshop, you will better understand:

- How to master using props with components
- Best practices for creating and maintaining props
- Scalable patterns for reusable components

## Benefits

- Small classroom experience (12 students maximum)
- Interactive learning experience with code challenges
- Opportunities to ask questions about your own code
