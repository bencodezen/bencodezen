## Overview

This week has been a challenging one since I found myself overwhelmed with the amount of things I was trying to do at once. And while the easiest explanation is that I signed myself up for too much, I know that a large part of it is due to my productivity system missing the infrastructure required to manage the workload I want to take on.

Due to a stroke of luck and good fortune of talking with the incredible [Katie](https://twitter.com/KatieMaeFritz), I was able to find a path forward to take my old system and begin the steps necessary for me to make progress on the various projects in my life. 

With a little bit more luck and effort, here's to hoping I get back to building things on a more regular basis going forward. Cheers!  🥂

## Achievements

- Finished The Effective Engineer
- Began evolution of my productivity system by integrating it with Notion's database model

## Picks of the Week

### [Design for Developers](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/design-for-developers)

> I have spent many years believing my #design skills would never amount to much. To my surprise, @sarah_edo's course: "Design for #Developers" on @FrontendMasters gave me the spark I needed to brave those waters once again.

### The Effective Engineer

I bought this book a while ago and have been meaning to get around to it. Definitely a great read for anyone interested in learning from Edmond's experience in Silicon Valley. I learned a lot from the book and also felt good that a lot of my own philosophies coincided with Edmond's which let me know that I was on the right path. 

It's worth noting that I purchased the Master Package and will be sure to write about that when I've finished the various pieces of it. In the meantime, I'll make sure to write up a full review of the book for those who are interested.

### Carmen Sandiego

While I have my reservations about the constant rebooting of concepts from my childhood, I thought they did a phenomenal job with this series by putting a brand new spin on Carmen Sandiego. On top of that, the show reminded me a lot of Kim Possible and Batman Beyond. So definitely a fun watch for all ages!
