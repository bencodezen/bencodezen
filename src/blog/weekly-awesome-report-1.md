## Overview

The theme of this week has been putting the [progress over perfection](/blog/progress-over-perfection.html) principle I wrote about into practice. Thanks to the incredible [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for making it effortless to deploy changes to the public, I released so many iterations on the site this week it's mind boggling to me. The old version of me would have sat on the initial version of the site for weeks before showing anyone anything.

## Achievements

- 🖼️ Created a [new landing page](https://www.bencodezen.io) for my site
- 📝 Wrote three blog posts
- 🏗️ Released an alpha version of [VuePress Blog Boilerplate](https://vuepress-blog-boilerplate.bencodezen.io/)
