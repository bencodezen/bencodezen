## Overview

This week was a particularly difficult one because it was my first failure for this year. Up until this week, I had managed to release some form of content on the blog almost daily. And while I would have loved to keep that up, I knew I was a moment's away from falling off the wagon since the content was being generated the day of and very spontaneous. And so the inevitable happened, I got overloaded with other priorities and was unable to write for much of this week.

For some, this might seem like a small misstep as opposed to a failure. However, in my past experience, even a misstep like this often led to a detrimental string of habit degradation because I would feel ashamed that I wasn't able to complete my goal with 100% perfection. Silly and irrational. I know. 😅

However, as the motto for this year is clearly "progress over perfection," I had to take on that misstep head on and drive forward regardless of my frustration with being able to meet my (unrealistic to be honest) expectations for myself. Yes, I did not write as much as I would have liked. And yes, I did not stream as much as I intended. However, it is okay because I am going to pick up the pieces and try again next week.

Till next week. Cheers! 🥂
