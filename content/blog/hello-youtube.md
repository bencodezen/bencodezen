It's been a long time coming, but excited to announce that I am officially launching my YouTube channel today!

🎉🍻👨‍💻📹🍻🎉

To be honest, it's been quite a journey. This has been something that's been on my mind for some time; but whether it be imposter syndrome or fear of not being able to follow through, I was always hesitant to get into creating content for YouTube.

However, I'm excited to share what I've been working on this past month with you. In the meantime, enjoy the inaugural intro video for the channel!
