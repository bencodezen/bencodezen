## ‚≠ê Highlights

1. [Tig](https://jonas.github.io/tig/) is one of my favorite tools for enhancing the git CLI experience. Highly recommended!
2. Vue Draggable ended up being a wash as far as being able to get up and running quickly, but we were able to utilize [VueUse's useDraggable](https://vueuse.org/core/useDraggable/) to make a very rudimentary prototype. Keyword: rudimentary. üòÖ

## ü§î Final Thoughts

For my one major takeaway from this experience, when things don't work, bring it down another level to find a path forward. The reason this is critical is because this means you'll make progress, which often yields opportunities for growth and learning. So while my drag and drop is 99.999% far from production ready, it was still a lot of fun!
