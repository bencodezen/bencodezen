## Overview

This week has been an absolute whirldwind and quite exhausting, but gratifying at the same time because it feels like the wheels are begining to really turn. In case it isn't obvious, I am trying my utmost to burn "progress over perfection" into my muscle memory as I churn out content piece after content piece. And the fear of releasing new content is still ever present with me. This is especially true of the YouTube videos I've started uploading since they have zero editing or planning with them. Just go to keep moving forward so I don't dwell too much on it...

Aside from my doubts and insecurities, I do want to say that I feel like I'm starting to internalize my mistakes with each piece I create which helps the next one. So even though the process has been scary, it has allowed me to iterate pretty quickly. Will this work long term? Only time will tell, but I will be sure to keep recording my progress here. Till next week. Cheers! 🥂
