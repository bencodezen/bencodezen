Let's start with the obvious: 2020 did not go exactly as planned for anyone. When I look back at my [2019 Retrospective](https://www.bencodezen.io/blog/2019-retrospective), it's funny looking at what I thought 2020 would be like, and what it ended up being instead.

## Making the Best of 2020

2020 started off with an exciting milestone for me as I joined the Vue.js core team and started a brand new Vue.js podcast: [Enjoy the Vue](https://www.enjoythevue.io). And then to top it off, I got to attend VueConfUS in person and had an incredible time teaching a workshop and emceeing the conference with my amazing co-host [Maria Lamardo](https://twitter.com/MariaLamardo).

And though it started off well, the reality is that whatever plan I had for the rest of year was out of the window. With plans disrupted by the pandemic (i.e., I was supposed to travel to Australia for ComponentConf), like everyone else, I made the best I could of the situation.

### Accomplishments

While it's been a rollercoaster of emotions this year, here are some of the things I managed to accomplish:

- 🎉 Joined the Vue.js core team
- 🎤 Spoke and/or taught workshops at over 10 events
- 👨‍🏫 Taught my first Frontend Masters workshop
- 🗣️ Spoke at my first Smashing Magazine event
- 🌄 Started a new Vue.js podcast: [Enjoy the Vue](https://www.enjoythevue.io)
- 🎙 Recorded over 50 podcast episodes
- 🎒 Created four courses - [Component Design Patterns - Vue Mastery](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/component-design-patterns/introduction/) - [Vue 3 and TypeScript - Vue Mastery](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/vue3-typescript/why-vue-&-typescript/) - [Production-Grade Vue - Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/workshops/production-vue/) - [Launching with Composition API - Netlify](https://explorers.netlify.com/learn/launching-with-composition-api?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=mission-lca-bh&utm_campaign=devex)
- 📹 Started a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/bencodezen) and published 30 videos

That said, it's important not to understate the difficulties encountered this year.

### Obstacles

Without going too much into the details, here are some of the key obstacles that 2020 presented for me:

- Being separated from friends and family which impacted my mental health like many others
- Attempting to be productive but failing time and time again
- Many hours spent trying new things and making lots mistakes and finding dead ends

Since all my time was spent indoors and away from the public, it's been a lot of trial and error. **A lot** of trial and error. Here are just some of the things I've tried:

- Yoga
- Knitting
- Communication Workshop
- Podcast
- Voice Coach
- Brand Strategist
- Ukulele Lessons
- Part Time YouTube Academy
- Second-Brain
- Productivity Systems
- Peloton

And we haven't even listed all the tech and gear I've purchased trying to accommodate the new lifestyle. 😅

## Next Steps

Unlike last year, I won't try and make any big proclamations about what 2021 will be like. I just know that I will keep trying to make the best of each day and try to live it according to a set of principles and values I can be proud of. And if can end the day each ["good tired"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbpoUWO3kA8), then that will be enough for me.

With all that said, while it's certainly been a challenging year, I am incredibly grateful to everyone who made helped make the best out of it. And a big thank you to all those who have supported my work
