Today's post is about recognizing the need to pivot. What to pivot on exactly? Well, my strategy for creating content. And while it has only been a few weeks, I have come to realize that learning to cut your losses and adapt is critical to long term success. So this post is to record this moment of admission that my original plan has failed and it is time to move on.

## The Original Plan

One of the hardest things about blogging is being consistent. The other aspect that others also find difficult is finding a consistent set of content to release as well. So as I began to ramp up my writing at the beginning of the year, I set out to figure out a series of hashtags that I could use as a structure for my writing. It looked something like this:

- Sunday Studies
- Motivation Monday
- Tutorial Tuesday
- Workflow Wednesday
- Thursday Thoughts
- Friday Festivities
- Saturday Solutions

Did I spend too much time trying to come up with alliterations for each day? I absolutely did. ðŸ˜…

## Reality Sets In

While it worked out for a bit, it became unrealistic for me to write at a pace that would allow me to release content seven days a week. And surprisingly enough, it's not because I didn't have enough ideas to fill each day. Given the proper attention and time, I'm actually not concerned about that.

Instead, the problem is that this is something I do in my free time. And while I would love to consistently write for an hour every morning to produce content, the realities of life simply did not permit it. If I devoted all of my time to writing, other aspects of my life would inevitably suffer. And in the inteest of practicing self-care, I knew this was a dangerous path to go down.

## Moving Forward

When it comes to the pursuit of balance, there are three main aspects that I'm trying to keep in mind:

- Mental Health
- Physical Health
- Spiritual Health

Neglecting any one of the three often leads to lower output from the other two, so it's something I will have to be more intentional about as time goes on. It is easy for me to get wrapped up with writing, coding, and studying more than I realize. So while I would like to eventually revisit the daily release of content, for now the blog have to be a bit more spontaneous.
